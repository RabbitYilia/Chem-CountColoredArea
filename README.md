# Intro
A simple python program to count the colored area in the whole view.

When after doing experiment,it's common to calculate how much targets are colored.

In my way,it's a good way to calculate the colored area in the picture.Because the color area is releated to the amount of the targets.

So the problem turns to how to get the mount of the specfic pixcel in the picture.
# The Method
This Program will view all the pixcel in the picture then turn the useless pixcel to black.In the same way ,turn the different target into blue with weight.

then calculate the counted target will get the result

# Todo 

- Find A better way to calculate
- Find A better to get characteristic
- To use AI to ignore the useless area?
